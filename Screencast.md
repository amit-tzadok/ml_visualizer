# Screencast script — ml_visualizer CopilotKit demo

Length: 2–3 minutes

1. Opening (0:00-0:20)

   - Title slide: "ML Visualizer — CopilotKit Demo"
   - Quick intro: your name and what the demo shows (CopilotKit integrated into a client-side ML visualization app).

2. Show the app + assistant (0:20-1:10)

   - Open `ml_visualizer` in the browser.
   - Click "Assistant" in the header to open the CopilotKit popup.
   - Ask an example question about the codebase (e.g., "Where is the MLP implementation?"), show retrieved source snippet from `src/utils/mlp.ts` or `public/docs/assistant_context.md`.

3. Demonstrate assistance for a task (1:10-1:50)

   - Ask the assistant to change a model parameter (e.g., "How do I increase learning rate?").
   - Optionally, show a code patch or explain where to change it (point to file location in repo).
   - Show the assistant returning provenance: which file/snippet it used.

4. Growth & analytics mention (1:50-2:10)

   - Briefly show that assistant interactions are tracked (console or dashboard screenshot) and suggest an experiment (A/B prompt templates or retrieval chunking).

5. Closing (2:10-2:30)
   - Quick summary and link to the repo & README.

Recording checklist

- Use 1280x720 resolution
