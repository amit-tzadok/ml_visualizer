## Security Policy

If you discover a security vulnerability in this project, please report it privately so we can address it before public disclosure.

Report a vulnerability

- Email: security@your-domain.example (replace with an appropriate private contact)
- Include: steps to reproduce, affected versions, and a minimal reproduction if possible.

We will acknowledge new reports within 3 business days and provide an estimated timeline for remediation.

Maintainer notes

- Consider enabling automated security alerts (Dependabot) and a vulnerability scanning service (e.g. Snyk) for continuous monitoring.
- For high-severity issues, we may release a private patch before public disclosure to allow users to upgrade safely.
