Reporting

- Do NOT post security issues publicly (issues, PRs, Twitter, etc.).
- Please email security reports to: amit.tzadok@icloud.com (replace with a real contact email) — include steps to reproduce, affected versions, and a minimal repro if available.

Response

- We will acknowledge receipt within 3 business days and provide an estimated timeline for a fix.
- For critical issues, we may provide patches on a private branch until users can upgrade.

Disclosure

- After a fix is available and users have had a reasonable time to upgrade, we may publicly disclose the vulnerability.

Third-party dependencies

- Keep your environment up-to-date and monitor dependency advisories for `p5`, `react`, `vite`, and other packages used by this project.

Notes for maintainers

- Consider using automated dependency scanning (GitHub Dependabot, Snyk) and CI checks for known vulnerabilities.
