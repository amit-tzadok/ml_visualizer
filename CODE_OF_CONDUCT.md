# Contributor Covenant Code of Conduct

Our Pledge

In the interest of fostering an open and welcoming environment, we as contributors and maintainers pledge to make participation in our project and our community a harassment-free experience for everyone.

Standards

Examples of behavior that contributes to a positive environment include:

- Using welcoming and inclusive language
- Being respectful of differing viewpoints and experiences
- Gracefully accepting constructive criticism
- Showing empathy towards other community members

Unacceptable behavior includes harassment and discrimination in any form. This includes but is not limited to abusive language, threats, and doxxing.

Enforcement

Instances of abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behavior may be reported by contacting the project maintainers at `amit.tzadok@icloud.com`. All complaints will be reviewed and investigated and will result in a response that is deemed necessary and appropriate to the circumstances.
